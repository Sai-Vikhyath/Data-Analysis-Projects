# Data-Analysis-Projects
Welcome to my repository of Data Analysis projects! This collection showcases my work on various datasets, where I apply data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights.

## Projects Overview
In this repository, you will find a range of data analysis projects that involve the following:

Data Cleaning & Wrangling: Transforming raw data into a usable format.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing data to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Statistical Analysis: Using statistical methods to derive insights from the data.

Machine Learning: Applying predictive models to solve real-world problems.

## Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Languages: Python, SQL.

Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Power BI.

Database: MySQL.


## Repository Structure
project_1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data science and ML.

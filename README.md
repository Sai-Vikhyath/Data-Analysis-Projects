# Data-Analysis-Projects
Welcome to my repository of Data Analysis projects! This collection showcases my work on various datasets, where I apply data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights.

## Projects Overview
In this repository, you will find a range of data analysis projects that involve the following:

Data Cleaning & Wrangling: Transforming raw data into a usable format.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing data to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Statistical Analysis: Using statistical methods to derive insights from the data.

Machine Learning: Applying predictive models to solve real-world problems.

## Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Languages: Python, SQL.

Libraries & Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Power BI.

Database: MySQL.


## Repository Structure
project_1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data science and ML. 
  - This project provides a comprehensive guide to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, with a focus on both regression and classification tasks.
  - Additionally, EDA techniques are applied to the iris dataset for classification, enabling the enhancement of predictive models through detailed data insights and feature engineering.
  - I have worked with the diabetes dataset to implement data preprocessing, handle missing values, perform one-hot encoding, and generate key visualizations.

Project_2: Data Analysis with Banking.
 - This project explores a banking dataset to analyze customer responses to telemarketing campaigns using Pandas.
 - Key tasks include calculating the average call duration, customer age, and response rates, as well as creating pivot tables and visualizations to gain insights into client behavior.
 - The project leverages data exploration techniques to help plan more effective marketing strategies for banks.

project_3: Analyzing and Enhancing the Fuel Economy Data.

project_4: Sales Performances Analysis and Dashboard Development using Power BI.

Each project contains the following:

data/: Dataset(s) used in the analysis.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts with the analysis.

results/: Visualizations, graphs, or summary reports.
